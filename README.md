Track altitude with GPS
=======================

Track altitude (only) during hiking via GPS. The idea is to show only the altitude on the screen and measure the min and max.
Eventually to store reference altitudes, such as your home location on the start of the hiking, etc.

From technical perspective the implementation in done with PhoneGap.
